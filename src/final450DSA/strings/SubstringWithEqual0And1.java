/**
 * Count Number Of Substrings with equal 0 and 1 GFG =>
 * <p>
 * Given a binary string str of length N, the task is to find the maximum count of consecutive substrings str can be
 * divided into such that all the substrings are balanced i.e. they have equal number of 0s and 1s. If it is not
 * possible to split str satisfying the conditions then print -1.
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: str = “0100110101”
 * Output: 4
 * The required substrings are “01”, “0011”, “01” and “01”.
 * <p>
 * Input: str = “0111100010”
 * Output: 3
 * <p>
 * Input: str = “0000000000”
 * Output: -1
