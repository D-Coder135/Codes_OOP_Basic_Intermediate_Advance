/**
 * Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements
 * in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * N = 7
 * a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
 * Output:
 * 6
 * Explanation:
 * The consecutive numbers here
 * are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6
 * numbers form the longest consecutive
 * subsquence.
