/**
 * Given an array of size n and a range [a, b]. The task is to partition the array around the range such
 * that array is divided into three parts.
 * <p>
 * 1) All elements smaller than a come first.
 * 2) All elements in range a to b come next.
 * 3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
 * The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * n = 5
 * A[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
 * [a, b] = [1, 2]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: One possible arrangement is:
 * {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. If you return a valid
 * arrangement, output will be 1.
